### Start exploring Tarantool!

You have access to a test service with the Tarantool platform up and running. It is deployed in the cloud and ready for use.

Complete the training, and you will be able to:

* configure a cluster
* define a data schema
* set up HTTP API for clients
* implement write/read requests
* scale the cluster

Your cluster is accessible from the outside. Upon completing the tutorial, you can connect to it and work with data using any HTTP-client or from your IDE.

You can find the user name, password, and cluster address in the **How to connect** section. This section also describes how to connect to a Tarantool cluster from your programming language and contains a minimal code sample.

The test environment deployed for this tutorial will be discarded after 24 hours of inactivity. So we do not recommend using this service for critical projects.

To install this environment and follow the same instructions on your machine, go to the **"What's next?"** section at the very end of the tutorial.
